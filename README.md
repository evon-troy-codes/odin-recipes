# Odin Recipes

## Project Overview

This project, called **Odin Recipes**, is part of The Odin Project curriculum. It involves creating a simple website that consists of a main index page with links to a few recipes. This project demonstrates basic HTML skills and introduces the structure of a web page.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

- Basic HTML structure and elements
- Creating links and navigation
- Building a multi-page website
- Using lists and images in HTML

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html` - The main landing page with links to individual recipes.
- `recipe1.html` - A page dedicated to the first recipe.
- `recipe2.html` - A page dedicated to the second recipe.
- `recipe3.html` - A page dedicated to the third recipe.

Each recipe page includes the following sections:

- Recipe title
- Ingredients list
- Steps to prepare the dish

## Future Enhancements

In the future, I plan to enhance this project by adding CSS to style the pages and possibly some JavaScript to make the website more interactive.

## Reflection

(At the end of the project, you can add a reflection here about what you learned and any challenges you faced.)

This project is a great way to reinforce the basics of HTML and get comfortable with building simple websites. I'm excited to continue building on these skills in future projects.
